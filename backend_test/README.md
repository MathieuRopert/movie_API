# ADDE BackEnd Test

Welcome to the ADDE backend Technical Test. In this test, you will need to create a small backend application using the technologies that we at ADDE use in our daily routine.

## Stack

In this test, we encourage you tu use the technologies that we use in our daily basis:

-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
-   [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

If you want to use other technologies or add features in order to enhance your application (such as Nx, Jest, Nest, Mongoose), you are more than welcome to do so.

# The Test

In this test, you will need to create a small REST API endpoint for managing a movie ratings collection.
Users should be able to create, read, update and delete movies from the collection.
Collection are specific to each user, so you will need to implement an authentication system in order to manage the movies.

Your application should have the following features:

-   authentication
-   CRUD operations for movies
-   the project should be dockerizable
-   the project should be covered by tests

# Rules

-   We strongly suggest that you use the technologies suggested under the Stack section. If you want to use another technology such as Python or PHP because you do not know Node, you can do so, but take into consideration that we do not use them in our daily basis.
-   If you want to use your own boilerplate, feel free to override the whole repository.
-   Keep in mind several aspects of the application, not only functionality. Such as security, performance, usability, maintainability, scalability.
-   This test should take you a day to complete, if you need more time or if you have any questions, please reach out to ADDE.
-   In order to deliver the project, please create a public GitHub repository and upload your code to it.

# Setup

in order to start the project, you will need to install the dependencies using `npm install` and then run the project using `npm run dev`. This will start the project in `localhost:3000` in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
